// Data Types
// in all programming langages there are different data Types for numbers, strings, true-false values ... 

// JavaScript has 5 primitive DATA TYPES: 
// 1. Number : Floating point numbers, for decimals and integers 
// 2. String : Sequence characters, used for text
// 3. Boolean : Logical data type that can only be true or false
// 4. Undifined : Data type of a variable which does not have a value yet
// 5. Null : also means 'non-existent' 

// primitive just means that these are not objects, only primitives (simple data types)

// JavaScirpt numbers are always floating point numbers meaning that they always have decimals, even
// if we sometimes don't see or define them for example 5 just like having 5.0 .	 	 

// Undifined is the data type that is automatically assigned to a variable which does not have value yet.

// JavaScript has dynamic typing which means that we do no have to manually define the data type of a variable
// JS figure out the data type of a variale on it's own and on the fly	meaning that we can even change 
// the data type of a variable later in our code. this can be very useful but it can also be the source of some difficulty to find 	 
// bugs.
