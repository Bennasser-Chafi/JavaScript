    <!-- In order to write a JavaScript code, we need a place where we can do that!, and there are
    2 main ways in which we can write JS -->

    <!-- The first way is to write our code right inside the <script></script> tag in the HTML file 
    and that's called inline script. -->

    <script type="text/javascript">
    	console.log("Hello World!");
    </script>

    <!-- The second way is to use an external file and then link the HTML file with JavaScript file. -->
    <!--  We usually prefer the second method because in the first way, it's difficult to maintain the code, and also it's better to keep the web site content and the JavaScript logic in seperate places-->

    <script type="text/javascript" src="script.js" ></script>
